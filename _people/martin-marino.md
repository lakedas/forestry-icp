After many years experience leading venture-backed technology companies as a CEO, Steve is now in pseudo-retirement and happily investing his time advising young entrepreneurs and the companies they lead. He is a founding Partner in Island Capital Partners.

Steveâ€™s career has taken him from Canada to Europe and the United States. His executive experience spans telecoms, video surveillance, wireless convergence, and healthcare IT. The companies he has led have delivered innovative customer value, returned over $300M to their investors, and provided employment to thousands of truly great people.

Steve is a computer science graduate of Western University. He started his career at Bell Northern Research as a software developer and aspires to be the first person to write an app for the iPhone in FORTRAN. Steve still plays hockey, pretends to know how to golf, and loves to travel with his family. He is a dual, Canadian-American citizen and currently lives in Atlanta, Georgia with a summer residence in beautiful Prince Edward Island, where he was born.
