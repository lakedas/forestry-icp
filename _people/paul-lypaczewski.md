Over the last 30 years, Paul has held a number of executive management positions in the computer graphics and software industries, in a senior leadership role at major NASDAQ and NYSE firms such as Autodesk, AMD and Avid. As VP of Product Development at Alias, he was an integral part of the executive team that took the company over a three-year period from the brink of bankruptcy back to being the preeminent provider of 3D animation and industrial design software, resulting in a $450M acquisition by Silicon Graphics.

As the General Manager of Autodesk’s media division (Discreet) and of Avid’s Video and Broadcast business, Paul directed the organizational, product and cultural changes necessary to recast strategic direction and return these divisions to profitability. He started his career in aerospace and has been CEO/Chairman of pre-public and start up companies in the fields of web graphics and social networking.

Paul has received a number of awards and recognitions for his efforts, including being the first Canadian to receive the NASA Space Act Award for exceptional merit, and also devotes time to numerous not for profit organizations. He is currently one of four Managing Partner at Island Capital Partners, an early stage seed fund and personally invests in and consults with a number of early stage startups.
