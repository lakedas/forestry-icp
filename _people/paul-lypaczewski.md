As VP of Product Development at Alias, he was an integral part of the executive team that took the company over a three-year period from the brink of bankruptcy back to being the preeminent provider of 3D animation and industrial design software, resulting in a $450M acquisition by Silicon Graphics.

Paul has received a number of awards and recognitions for his efforts, including being the first Canadian to receive the NASA Space Act Award for exceptional merit, and also devotes time to numerous not for profit organizations. He is currently one of four Managing Partner at Island Capital Partners, an early stage seed fund and personally invests in and consults with a number of early stage startups.
