FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**PhotoDynamic Secures Investment from the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO)**

_Closes $2.3M of Financing for Novel Oral Hygiene Technology and Becomes the First Ever Investment for the Newly Established AAO Innovation Fund_

_Halifax, NS; January 27, 2020_ – PhotoDynamic, Inc. has secured investment funding from the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), completing a series of successful financing rounds totaling CAD$2.3M. The Halifax-based company has developed a patented light-activated antimicrobial oral hygiene technology designed to kill bacteria which causes plaque and overcome challenges associated with traditional oral hygiene regimens. Discovered by Dr. Sherri McFarland, a world-renowned expert on photo activated chemistry, the technology completed successful clinical trials in 2018.

“While applicable to anyone’s hygiene regimen, our technology solves a particular problem for orthodontists and their patients who can face real difficulties maintaining good oral hygiene during treatment,” said Martin Greenwood, CEO of PhotoDynamic. Scheduled to launch this fall, the company’s daily oral hygiene technology combines a natural botanical foam and a light-emitting medical device. Greenwood explains that “Receiving the AAO investment provides a great opportunity to further connect with the orthodontic community and further promote the potential patient impact of our technology”.

In May 2019, the AAO established a fund to support innovation that advances the specialty of orthodontics. The fund can be used to develop new products and services for orthodontists and patients by building, partnering or investing. “The AAO thoroughly vetted PhotoDynamic. We were impressed with the clinical results and the potential to improve orthodontic patient care” said Dr. Gary O. Inman, AAO President. “We’re delighted to have Martin and the PhotoDynamic team as our first investment.”

In addition to the AAO and several dental angel investors, the $2.3M financing round includes major investors Island Capital Partners and Natural Products Canada. Island Capital Partners is a Prince Edward Island based early stage venture fund supporting local innovation while Natural Products Canada is a national not-for-profit corporation with an investment fund dedicated to naturally derived products, technologies, and services.

“PhotoDynamic’s ground-breaking product is a perfect example of the power of natural compounds to create truly disruptive market opportunities,” says Shelley King, CEO of Natural Products Canada. “We are proud to invest in this high-potential company and support them in their commercialization journey.” Joining the PhotoDynamic board will be Stephen Ball, Regional Director (Atlantic) of Natural Products Canada, along with Ron Keefe, ICP partner and former CEO of Biovectra, and Dr. Michael Sherman an Orthodontist and Trustee with the AAO.

Greenwood adds, “We’ve gathered a group of strategic investors that can assist with our supply and sourcing on Prince Edward Island, elevate our expertise in developing leading edge natural products, and strengthen connections with our core orthodontic market; we couldn’t be happier with this investment round.”
