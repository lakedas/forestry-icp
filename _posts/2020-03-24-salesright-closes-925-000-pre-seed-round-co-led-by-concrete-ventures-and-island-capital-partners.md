**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE** MARCH 24, 2020

HALIFAX -- SalesRight has raised $600,000 in its pre-seed round co-led by Concrete Ventures and Island Capital Partners. The funding brings SalesRight’s total raised since 2018 to $925,000.

SalesRight is an interactive quote delivery software that streamlines sales processes for SaaS teams. The software’s Interactive Live Quotes support the development and delivery of multiple SaaS pricing models, while providing real-time analytics on deal status. Users report increased conversion rates and reduced time spent per opportunity when using SalesRight. SalesRight employs talent from across the country, basing its headquarters out of Atlantic Canada’s premier innovation hub Volta, with remote team members based in Prince Edward Island and Ontario.

Patrick Hankinson of Concrete Ventures says “As businesses grow in complexity, often times so does their pricing. Any time your team is unable to easily communicate your pricing, you effectively slow down your sales process and sometimes even put deals at risk of not closing. SalesRight makes it easy to communicate even the most challenging pricing structures."

Stefanie Corbett of Island Capital Partners says “The SalesRight team has an exciting vision for the product, and the experience necessary to quickly action their growth. We’re pleased to support SalesRight as they enter this next phase of expansion.”

CEO Bill Wilson notes this funding will support the momentum SalesRight has built in their first year. “We’ve built a solution that drastically reduces the time investment necessary to close deals. It’s not only meeting the needs of high-velocity SaaS sales teams, it’s ushering in a new era of how sales are pursued and closed. We’re pleased to have this vision supported by Concrete Ventures and Island Capital Partners.”

The funds will be used to support SalesRight’s next phase of product enhancements, which includes providing public pricing for marketing teams and expanding offerings that support the needs of high-velocity SaaS sales teams.
