Stash Energy Inc. (Stash) has built a storage system that works with conventional heat pumps to thermally store energy for later use, which prevents usage during peak times. Peak times are the costliest for utility companies, causing heavy demands on generating stations. Peak times affect both operating costs and C02 emissions.
