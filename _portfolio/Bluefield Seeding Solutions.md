Bluefield Seeding Solutions Inc. (Bluefield) has developed “The Press Wheel”, technology used in the planting of crops such as potatoes, corn, and soya beans. The Press Wheel will allow farms to produce higher quality crops in a more efficient manner. The technology senses the seed as it shoots out of the potato planter and helps to control the seed placement as well as allowing the planter to move at almost twice the speed that it currently operates at today.
